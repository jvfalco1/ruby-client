The Ruby Client is a client for accessing the The Ruby Server. It is a fork of the [OTClient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient) project.

### Getting Started

In short, if you need to compile RubyClient, follow these tutorials:

* [Compiling on Windows](https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows)
* [Compiling on Linux](https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows)
* [Compiling on OS X](https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-on-Mac-OS-X)

**NOTE**: You will need to download spr/dat files [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aba8pwepy364yg8/AAAteTPnKULj0j61_M9Xo9Rfa?dl=0) and place them in data/things/1098/

### Support

We do not yet have a special place for support.

### Issues

We use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/rubyserver/rubyclient/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meaningful for an issue (e.g. "+1"). If you'd like for an issue to be fixed faster, you should either fix it yourself and submit a pull request, or place a bounty on the issue.
